# DAY 3

## WRITING R PACKAGES (ANDERSON)

The third day of the TTT workshop started with a presentation by Sean Anderson on R
package development. Anderson used materials from presentations by Hadley
Wickham (senior scientist at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)) to get
participants started with developing
R packages. The development of R packages is greatly simplified by using an
RStudio project, and taking advantage of its many available tools related to
package development. For example, one can create a project in RStudio and
define it as an R package, and the software will create the necessary backbone
of an R package. Anderson covered the development of an R package, the
generation of its documentation using roxygen2, unit testing of the package, and
checking of the package against common standards using `R CMD check`.

Participants performed exercises to learn how to alter an example package.
Anderson demonstrated a number of useful functions for package development in
the R packages devtools and usethis. Anderson presented resources from
Hadley Wickham such as *Advanced R* [@Wickham2014], *R Packages*
[@Wickham2015], and *R for Data Science* [@Wickham2017]. These resources are
available on-line as well as in print form.

## TRANSLATING CSAS DOCUMENTS (MARISCAK)

Ann Mariscak (Pacific Region CSAS office) spoke regarding
new policies for generating CSAS documents. As a
legal requirement, DFO must ensure that all CSAS documents are
available in both official languages. Also, all
CSAS documents be accessible for persons with disabilities and be compatible with
tools such as screen readers. It was noted that translation of text will slow
the final output of documents and increase their cost. Tools such as LaTeX and
csasdown may be able to assist, and thereby shorten the time and
reduce the cost to produce fully translated and accessible documents. 

A big problem is
translation of figures into the other
official language. It was suggested that it might be possible for an automated
translation of frequently used words such as "Age" or "Fork length."
Mariscak mentioned a recent example of having to manually replace all the words 
by their translated versions in
all the figures in a lengthy Research Document; this took someone 35 hours,
excluding the time and expense of actually getting the words translated. 
This motivated participants' development of the rosettafish package (see below),
such that authors should somewhat easily be able to create figures in both 
languages.
Mariscak also noted that manual editing (through Photoshop and other tools) often degrades figure quality.

### Editing vs. translation

There was a suggestion that documents can be translated using Google
Docs, and then sent for 'editing' as opposed to 'translation.' If editing is
a less expensive service than translation, this could be an option worth
considering in some situations. Authors choosing to follow this approach would have to
ensure the integrity of the text was correctly maintained through the
translation process.

### Translation databases

Mariscak mentioned the existence of a Government of Canada database called
[Termium
Plus](https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha-eng.html?lang=eng).
Termium Plus is an invaluable tool used for the translation of technical
terminology. The quality of the translation is perpetually being improved
through expert-user feedback and contribution. Ricard made mention of another
translation document native to DFO called the [DFO Bilingual
Lexicon](http://intra.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/IntraCom/toolbox/pdf/lexicon-lexique-bil-2018.pdf), 
part of the [Writing and Publishing Tools](http://intra.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/IntraCom/toolbox/writing-tools-eng.htm) 
of the [DFO Communications Toolbox](http://intra.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/IntraCom/toolbox/home-eng.htm).

## BREAK-OUT GROUPS

Workshop participants separated into five break-out groups. Workshop
participants were able to self-select which group they went to, which worked
well.

The first group worked on an applied example, in which they worked
together to compose a trip report for the Newfoundland and Labrador Region using
R Markdown (see below).

The second group focused on a brainstorming session about the
development of tools to automate language translation of figures in CSAS
documents (Figure \ref{fig:genesis}). This resulted in the creation of a new R package
[rosettafish](https://github.com/pbs-assess/rosettafish), which translates
common figure annotations between English, French, and Inuktitut.

assessments.}

The remaining three groups worked on collaboratively writing text for this
workshop's Proceedings document using GitHub, with each group tasked with
summarising one day of the workshop. A Proceedings template document that met
the format requirements for a 'Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and
Aquatic Sciences' was compiled ahead of time by Matthew Grinnell.
The three report-writing groups
were able to clone the relevant repository and collaboratively draft this
Proceedings document.

### Multi-species survey automated report

A breakout group (Krista Baker, Brendan Connors, Kevin Hedges, Bob Roger, Mark
Simpson, and Laura Wheeland) was formed to work on an applied example of all of
the workshop topics. The group created a GitHub repository, an R project, and
an R Markdown document to standardize and automate the creation of survey
trip reports. The group used the Newfoundland and Labrador Region multispecies
surveys as a test case, and tailored the project to handling the particular data
structure from those surveys, but the project could easily be adapted for other
trip types (e.g., shellfish surveys). Work was divided among group members, and
coordinated through GitHub. Individual tasks included creating the GitHub
repository, creating the R project, drafting separate R Markdown files to
provide a trip summary, survey map, and catch summary, and then creating a
bookdown file to combine the separate R Markdown files into a single PDF report.
The R Markdown files combined standard text and dynamic calculations in R to
automatically generate survey details and summary results. By the end of the
workshop the report project was completed, and automated survey reports had been
successfully generated.
