# CONCLUSIONS

Common templates for CSAS reports (e.g., Research Documents, Science Responses) are useful to ensure web accessibility
standards and to
speed up publishing times for DFO reports. Assisting DFO employees with
standard translation tools between languages ensures rapid and equal quality
documents and presentations (especially quality of figures), regardless of the original
language. Common graphical standards for different plot
types draw more attention to the advice rather than the
particular mode of presentation. Seeking stronger standards in this regard
should aid the communication of science work, advice, and uncertainties.
Using tools that facilitate traceability and transferability (such as
GitHub, R packages, and R Markdown) for documenting and disseminating
assessment code, is a means of promoting a transparent line of work. This
transparency includes the decisions,
assumptions, and known issues which are key components of defensible science
advice.
Assessment and advice conforming to TTT can provide strong support for
decision-making that is based on such advice. 
These tools allow greater transferability and reproducibility in the
assessment process that permits new staff to come on-line quickly, and for the
process to better deal with staff changes and absences (e.g., owing to parental
leave). Furthermore, such transferability can reduce the stress on any one 
individual assessor,
since they know that the assessment can be completed by the rest of the team
if, for example, they get sick. This transferability is not the case if much of the code only
exists on their computer (in which case the assessment may not get completed).

It is important to be aware that
some of these tools require considerable
expertise, and can sometimes be difficult to set up due to minor technical
issues. If they are going to be used, dedicated staff and/or
training needs to be integrated into the stock assessment-advice workflow and
not simply as a side activity. In addition, using these tools in DFO assessment
work can promote greater within- and between-region collaboration that can
improve the speed and quality of science advice.
