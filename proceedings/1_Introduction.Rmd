# INTRODUCTION

<!-- From the TESA GCpedia site -->
The purpose of the Technical Expertise in Stock Assessment (TESA) program is to
promote stock assessment excellence through organizing national activities that
contribute to the development of expertise in stock assessment across Fisheries
and Oceans Canada (DFO).

In 2009, TESA was created in response to a loss of stock assessment expertise in 
DFO owing to retirements. Each year, TESA organises three or four training courses
and one or two topical workshops on stock assessment issues. TESA is a national
program with one or two representatives in each region. There is an internal
[GCpedia website](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/DFO_Science_TESA_ETES) 
(only accessible from the DFO network).

<!-- Adapting from updated abstract -->

A four-day TESA workshop was held to foster a
common understanding of modern computational methods and tools among stock
assessment scientists in DFO.
These tools enable efficient sharing of code and
writing of complex stock assessment documents within an assessment team, and
easy sharing of methods with others.
This should lead to more
transparent, traceable, and transferable (TTT) assessments in DFO.

The following definitions were used:

- \emph{Transparent} means a clear and open way to show data, code, and
results, such that others should be able to reproduce the assessment.

- \emph{Traceable} means that there is a clear link from database queries and code
to final results (numbers, tables, and
graphs in an assessment document).

- \emph{Transferable} means that it should be feasible for another person to 
reproduce an assessment and build upon it with a minimal
learning curve.

A fourth T could be \emph{Translatable} in the sense that with two official
languages, it is
important to ensure consistent and efficient translations
between official languages.

This document briefly summarises each day's presentations and activities. 
Various software demonstrations were given, and participants later split into 
breakout groups to work on various
projects and practice the techniques.
One group created an R package to produce an automated report
from a multispecies survey (that they intend to be used in real-time so that
the report can be produced during the survey). A second group created
[rosettafish](https://github.com/pbs-assess/rosettafish/), an
R package to facilitate efficient translation of text (e.g., axes
labels) within figures of [Canadian Science Advice Secretariat (CSAS)](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/index-eng.htm) documents. The package contains an expanding list of
translated technical terms (that users can help update), and also allows for
translation into Inuktitut.
A third group commenced writing this Proceedings document (using a template
by Matthew Grinnell), which was completed in the week after the workshop.
This demonstrates the efficiency of using these tools to work collaboratively.
Other groups worked on a variety of other projects, such as organising their existing code
into a more TTT-type framework.

The workshop took place at the Coast Bastion Hotel in Nanaimo, British Columbia
in an interactive
classroom setting (Figure \ref{fig:classroom}).  Workshop participants are
listed in Table \@ref(tab:participants).  Workshop materials specific to this
workshop are on the [TTT GitHub
repository](https://github.com/pbs-assess/TTTworkshop), with further training
materials and examples on the [git-course
repository](https://github.com/pbs-assess/git-course) and
the [csasdown repository](https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown).
