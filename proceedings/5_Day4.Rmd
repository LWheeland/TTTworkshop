# DAY 4

## Git FOR GOVERNMENT OF CANADA EMPLOYEES (RICARD)

Daniel Ricard spoke about [gccode](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca), a GitLab
enterprise account offered by the Government of Canada, through Shared Services Canada (SSC).
One must be on a Government of Canada
network to access the website and the remote Git server. DFO employees can
create an account on gccode, and use it as they would use
GitHub. One advantage of using gccode is that it is provided by SSC
and therefore has no privacy concerns that may arise from using a
publicly available system such as GitHub (although GitHub does provide private
repositories, and GitHub is not used to share data).
The downside is that the Git server
can only be accessed from one's office or a Virtual Private Network, and
so
cannot be used for collaboration with non-government colleagues.

## BREAK-OUT GROUPS

Workshop participants continued to work in small groups on tasks from the
previous day, including writing this report. They also continued to develop the
rosettafish R package, which will be used to translate more than 200 full pages of 
figures in @Anderson (under revision) for the final CSAS Research Document.
